Script 1, does not do what is suggested in the example. 
Why not grep the /etc/passwd file for the first names and surnames and get the home dir name from there?

Script 2, you seems to take the right path, but I would expect to save not only the file sizes but also their names;
after waking up just see which files are no longer there

Script 3, read carefully grandchildren and great-grandchildren are only processes you want to spoil

script 4, does not seem to display any user login names; do not expect a STOP string literally, here-document is used just as an example.
